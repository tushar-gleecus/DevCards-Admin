## Project Vision

The goal is to create an open-source admin template that includes multiple example screens, prebuilt sections, and thoughtfully designed UI patterns, all supported by a clean architecture and proper project setup.

It aims to serve as a strong starting point for SaaS platforms, internal dashboards, and admin panels, with built-in support for multi-tenancy, RBAC, and feature-based scaling.

## Overview

This project uses `Next.js 15 (App Router)`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS v4`, and `Shadcn UI` as the main stack.  
It also includes `Zod` for validation, `ESLint` and `Prettier` for linting and formatting, and `Husky` for pre-commit hooks.  

This will support `React Hook Form`, `Zustand`, `TanStack Table`, and other related utilities, and will be added with upcoming screens. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with config-driven UI and multi-tenant UI support are also planned as part of the feature roadmap.

The current version uses the [Tweakcn Tangerine](https://tweakcn.com/) theme for UI.

> Looking for a **Next 14 + Tailwind CSS v3** version instead?  
> Check out the [`archive/next14-tailwindv3`](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard/tree/archive/next14-tailwindv3) branch.  
> This branch uses a different color theme and is not actively maintained, though I'm trying to keep it updated with the latest changes and screens.

## Colocation File System Architecture

Pages, components, and logic are grouped by feature. Each route folder contains everything it needs. Shared UI, hooks, and config live at the top level. This keeps the codebase modular and easy to navigate as your app grows.
